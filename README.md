node v16.14.2

created with: `>nest new atog`

run with: `>npm run start` (`>npm run start:dev` for live reload)

see output at localhost:3000 (configured via main.ts)

test with `>npm run test`, `:e2e` and `:cov` options available for end to end testing and coverage respectively.

I like swagger, so ran `>npm install --save @nestjs/swagger swagger-ui-express`
